The design is customized for a UART with a 19,200 baud rate, 8 data bits 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, and no parity bits.

The Algorithmic State Machine with Datapath (ASMD) Chart for the UART Receiver subsystem is as shown below.

The ASMD Chart for the UART Transmitter subsystem can be constructed in a similar way; we find that it closely resembles that of the Receiver.
